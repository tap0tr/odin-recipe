        <h1>Recipe Description</h1>
            <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish. It consist of salted and fermented napa cabbage and Korean radish.</p>
            <p>This dish is not eaten by itself but enjoyed and savored with other main or side dishes. My favorite way of eating kimchi is with Korean BBQ or Kimchi stew.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Napa cabbage</li>
            <li>16 cups of water</li>
            <li>Korean sea salt (for salt water)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of cooking salt</li>
            <li>Glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li> gochugaru</li>
            <li>Korean radish/daikon radish</li>
            <li>Fine sea salt</li>
            <li>Korean fish sauce</li>
            <li>Salted fermented shrimp, minced</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Minced garlic</li>
            <li>Raw sugar</li>
            <li>Onions, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut cabbage into quarters and rinse in running water. Make sure stem is intact.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the salt in a large bowl of water. Dip the cabbage in it one at a time and transfer onto a tray for further salting.</li>
            <li>Pinch cooking salt and rub over thick part of cabbage. Open each leaf and sprinkle salt over thick part. Repeat process for all remaining cabbage.</li>
            <li>Put salted cabbage in a large food grade plastic container or large bucket. Close plastic bag or container tightly. Set cabbage aside for 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Once finished soaking, season with the homemade Kimchi seasoning. After all cabbage have been seasoned, put kimchi into a kimchi container or an airtight container with the lid on.</li>
            <li>Finally, leave out at room temperature for 24 hours, then move it into the refrigerator and wait 3-4 more days for it to have more flavor.</li>
        </ol>
