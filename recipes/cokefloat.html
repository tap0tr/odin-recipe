        <h1>Recipe Description</h1>
        <p>This is one the simplest drink desserts that I enjoy, especially on rainy days when I'm stuck at home.</p>
        <p>I remember back in high school, I would walk myself to the nearest diner and order myself a cup of Coke Float almost everyday.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vanilla ice cream or any flavor</li>
            <li>1 litre Coke</li>
            <li>Whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a spoonful of ice cream into a cup. Get as much ice cream as you want but don't fill the cup up fully.</li>
            <li>Pour coke into the same cup.</li>
            <li>Put whipped cream on top for a sweeter flavor and decoration.</li>
        </ol>
